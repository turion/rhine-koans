Let's draw something!
Rhine connects to the famous gloss library for 2d graphics.
Have a look at https://hackage.haskell.org/package/gloss to learn more about it!

The connection between Rhine and gloss is provided by the library https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rhine-gloss,
which encapsulates the effects of drawing pictures in gloss in a monad, 'GlossConcT',
and provides several clocks to interact with the gloss system.

To warm up, let's just draw a circle.
